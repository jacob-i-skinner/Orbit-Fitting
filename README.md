# Orbit-Fitting
Repository for my research code for the Spectroscopic M Dwarf Binary project under advisor Dr. Kevin Covey.

Dependencies: Python 3.6 (has not been tested with other versions), numpy, corner, emcee

This project is not an application, but a collection of scripts. If you want to fit orbits, take a look at master.py. If you want to peer at the inner workings, functions.py is your friend.
